## TODO

- [ ] Add more folders and files with code that does nothing to look more professional
- [ ] Create `create-react-use-c` package cuz this ecosystem is broken
- [ ] Add typescript support
- [ ] Make somebody else figure out publishing this to npm (I am still not over it)
- [ ] Remove typescript support
- [ ] Tell windows ppl to just use WSL
- [ ] esbuild is not cursed enough, gotta switch to something else
